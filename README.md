# Peachflix

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

## Technical Choices

### Routing

For the simple routing required of this app I chose to use React Router's browser router. With more time I would likely explore other options, both within React Router and other routing libraries, since this is an area I haven't dove into in a while.

### Styling

For simple apps such as this I like to stick with vanilla CSS. For something more complex I would likely persue a CSS-in-JS option, such as Emotion or styled-components.
